# GDSP Analysis & Visualization

## Project Overview

This project, conducted from November 2021 to March 2022, focuses on the analysis and visualization of the Gross State Domestic Product (GDSP) of Indian states and the impact of COVID. Led by Saketh Velidimalla, the project utilized Python for comprehensive data manipulation and visualization.

## Key Highlights

- Detailed analysis of Indian states' GDSP.
- Enhanced data aggregation in Google Colab through API manipulation.
- Utilization of Bokeh and Plotly for insightful visualizations.
- Integration of SQL stored procedures and triggers for advanced dataset refinement and algorithm development.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Bokeh
- SQL

## Project Goals

The primary objective was to gain insights into the economic state of Indian states, considering the effect of COVID. The project employed a combination of data manipulation, visualization, and advanced dataset refinement techniques to provide valuable insights.

## Project Structure

- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis.
- `visualization.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook focusing on visualization using Bokeh and Plotly.
- `sql_integration.sql`: SQL script for integrating stored procedures and triggers.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebooks in Google Colab.
2. Run the cells to execute the analysis and visualization code.
3. Review the SQL script for advanced dataset refinement.
